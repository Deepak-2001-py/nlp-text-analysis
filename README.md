## Installation

To set up the CrewAI-Groq Assignment Evaluator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crewai-groq-assignment-evaluator.git
   cd crewai-groq-assignment-evaluator
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setup

1. Set your Groq API key as an environment variable:
   ```python
   import os
   import getpass

   os.environ['GROQ_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass('Enter your Groq API key: ')
   ```

2. Initialize the language model:
   ```python
   from langchain_groq import ChatGroq

   llm = ChatGroq(model="gemma-7b-it", groq_api_key=os.environ['GROQ_API_KEY'])
   ```

## Usage

To evaluate an assignment:

1. Define the assignment text:
   ```python
   assignment_text = """
   Your assignment description here...
   """
   ```
2.create  agents and trask 
agent = Agent(
    role='name the Grader',
    goal='provide what to achive',
    backstory=f"""give background regarding agent""",
    verbose=True,
    llm=llm,
    allow_delegation=False
)

3. Create and run the evaluation crew:
   ```python
   from crewai import Crew
   crew = Crew(
       agents=[clarity_agent, relevance_agent, accuracy_agent, tone_agent, examples_agent],
       tasks=[task_clarity, task_relevance, task_accuracy, task_tone, task_examples]
   )

   result = crew.kickoff()
   print(result)
   ```

## System Architecture

The system is built on the following components:

- CrewAI: Orchestrates the workflow and manages agents
- Groq API: Provides advanced language processing capabilities
- Custom Agents: Specialized evaluators for different aspects of the submission
- Task Definitions: Specific instructions for each agent's evaluation process

## Agents and Tasks

The system uses five specialized agents:

1. Clarity Agent: Evaluates the clarity of the submission
2. Relevance Agent: Assesses the relevance of the content
3. Accuracy Agent: Checks factual accuracy
4. Tone Agent: Evaluates the appropriateness of tone
5. Examples Agent: Reviews the use and effectiveness of examples

Each agent performs a corresponding task (e.g., task_clarity, task_relevance) using the Groq API.

## Workflow

1. Initialize the CrewAI workflow
2. Receive student submission
3. Process submission through each agent
4. Agents interact with Groq API for evaluation
5. Consolidate results from all agents
6. Generate final grade or feedback report

## Customization

You can customize the evaluation criteria by modifying the agent definitions and task instructions in the respective Python files.
